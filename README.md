# EWO Todo app

A simple JavaFX application supporting the filling in of a PDF form and generating the final PDF for printing.

> This app is created to support a form my daughter needs to fill in for her Kung-Fu lessons every weak.
It holds all kinds of weekly tasks she has to comply to. When complete a 'Generate PDF' takes care of generating
the PDF setting checkboxes at the tasks completed in a pre-defined template.

I created this app to play around with JavaFX and native app creation alongside the fact that I don't like
filling in the forms manually every week.

Technologies used:
* java 8
* itextpdf
* com.zenjava's javafx-maven-plugin (for creating native apps Mac/Windows)
